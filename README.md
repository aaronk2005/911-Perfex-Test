# Perfex 911 Operator Testing Device

## Project Description
This project modernizes the original 1970s Perfex system used by the Toronto Police Department to assess 911 dispatcher candidates. Our new system simulates a high-pressure multitasking environment, combining a web-based test platform with a custom-built Arduino Taskbox for physical reaction tests.

Developed by Aaron Kleiman and Andrew Heraldo.

## Features
- **Web-Based Test Interface**: Digitalized modules including memory recall, note-taking, reading aloud, telephone call simulation, and map navigation.
- **Physical Taskbox**: Arduino-based hardware for tactile tests (buttons, dials, sliders) evaluating reaction speed and accuracy.
- **Automated Grading**: Scoring across both digital and physical tests.
- **Stress Simulation**: High-pressure task flow mimicking real 911 dispatch environments.
- **Sustainability Focus**: Fully eliminated paper usage.
